# Objective: compare the recommendations returned in two settings:
# i)  after excluding the top 50 games, as it can be manually done on the recommender website,
# ii) after excluding the top 51 games, which is impossible to manually do.
#
# The reason behind this experiment is that, if the top 50 games are excluded, then the 51st game should be the most
# important one. So, including/excluding the 51st game should have a large impact on the results... if the recommender
# takes it into account.
#
# The conclusion of this experiment is that there is not point in excluding any game outside of the top 50, because
# the recommender system does not seem to take these exclusions into account.
